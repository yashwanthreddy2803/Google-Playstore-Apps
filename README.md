# Google-Playstore-Apps
Understanding of  demographics, behavior, and preferences of the Google playstore user base.

WHAT IS THE DATASET ABOUT ?

The dataset I’ve chose to work on is “Google Play store Apps”. It contains the data of 
more than 600 thousand applications with various attributes such as -
• Application Name
• App ID
• Category
• Rating
• Installs
• Price
• Size and many more.

WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS DATA SET ?

Digital Distribution (Marketing) have always piqued my interest since the start. Google 
playstore is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. Besides this, the 
attributes available in the current data set helps me with a better understanding of 
demographics, behavior, and preferences of the Google play user base.

DOMAIN

Google Play Store comes under the domain of “Android Market” or “Digital 
Distribution”. It serves as the official appstore for certified devices running on the Android 
Operating System and its derivatives. Google play has also served as a digital media store, 
offering games, music, books, movies, and television programs. Applications are available 
through Google play either free of charge or at a cost.

INFO

Google Play originated from three distinct products: Android Market, Google Music, 
and Google eBookstore. The service allows users to browse and download applications 
developed with the Android SDK and published through Google. Users can also purchase 
hardware, such as Chromebooks, Google Nexus branded mobile devices, Chromecasts and 
accessories in specific countries.

GOALS/PLANS

• Role of rating on Application installs
• Finding the domain of applications in which most users are interested in
• How does updates effect the usage of an application
• Finding whether price is a barrier for Application installs
